This project demonstrates the use of a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image classification. Users can upload any image, and the model will predict and display the most likely label based on its training on the ImageNet dataset. The project leverages Hugging Face's transformers library for model loading and inference, and Google Colab for an interactive and accessible development environment. This setup provides an easy-to-use interface for experimenting with state-of-the-art image classification techniques. The project includes image preprocessing, model inference, and result visualization, offering insights into the capabilities of Vision Transformers in computer vision tasks.
